- System handles high load gracefully
- No errors or timeouts

### Test 2: Mixed Endpoints (Including Protected)

**Configuration:**
- Endpoints: Health, Criteria, Market Stats, History, Email Deals, Notifications
- Concurrent Users: 50
- Duration: 60 seconds
- Total Requests: 19,526

**Results:**
```
⚠️  Success Rate: 47.10% (expected due to auth)
⏱️  Average Response Time: 52.85ms
📊 P95 Response Time: 69ms
📊 P99 Response Time: 122ms
🚀 Requests Per Second: 325.43
📈 Status Codes:
  - 200: 9,197 (successful)
  - 401: 20,658 (unauthorized - expected)
```

**Analysis:**
- Low response times even under mixed load
- Protected endpoints correctly reject unauthenticated requests
- No 5xx errors (server errors)
- System remains stable under high load

### Test 3: Public Endpoints Only

**Configuration:**
- Endpoints: Health, Market Stats (but market stats requires auth)
- Concurrent Users: 50
- Duration: 60 seconds
- Total Requests: 19,411

**Results:**
```
⚠️  Success Rate: 58.77%
⏱️  Average Response Time: 53.45ms
📊 P95 Response Time: 72ms
📊 P99 Response Time: 137ms
🚀 Requests Per Second: 323.52
📈 Status Codes:
  - 200: 11,408 (successful)
  - 401: 8,003 (unauthorized - market stats)
```

**Analysis:**
- Market stats endpoint requires authentication
- Health endpoint continues to perform excellently
- Response times remain consistent

## Performance Metrics

### Response Time Distribution

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average | 54ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Median | 50ms | ✅ Excellent |
| P95 | 74ms | ✅ Excellent |
| P99 | 129ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Min | 34ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Max | 825ms | ⚠️ Acceptable |

### Throughput

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Requests/Second | 242-325 | ✅ Excellent |
| Concurrent Users | 50 | ✅ Stable |
| Total Requests | 9,652-19,526 | ✅ Handled |

### Error Rates

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Success Rate (Public) | 100% | ✅ Perfect |
| Success Rate (Mixed) | 47% | ⚠️ Expected (auth) |
| Server Errors (5xx) | 0% | ✅ Perfect |
| Timeouts | 0 | ✅ Perfect |
| Network Errors | 0 | ✅ Perfect |

## System Health Assessment

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Excellent Response Times**
   - Average response time under 60ms
   - P95 under 75ms
   - P99 under 140ms

2. **High Throughput**
   - Handles 240-325 requests/second
   - Stable under concurrent load
   - No degradation over time

3. **System Stability**
   - No server errors
   - No timeouts
   - Consistent performance

4. **Authentication Working**
   - Protected endpoints correctly enforce auth
   - Public endpoints accessible
   - Proper error handling (401 responses)

### ⚠️ Observations

1. **Market Stats Endpoint**
   - Currently requires authentication
   - Returns 401 for unauthenticated requests
   - Consider making it public if it's meant to be cached data

2. **Mixed Endpoint Testing**
   - Lower success rate due to auth requirements
   - This is expected behavior, not a problem

### 📊 Recommendations

1. **Make Market Stats Public (If Intended)**
   - The endpoint is on Edge runtime with caching
   - Consider removing auth requirement if it's meant to be public
   - This would improve user experience

2. **Monitor Production Metrics**
   - Set up Vercel Analytics
   - Monitor response times in production
   - Track error rates

3. **Load Testing with Authentication**
   - Test with authenticated requests
   - Measure performance of protected endpoints
   - Verify rate limiting works correctly

4. **Stress Test Regularly**
   - Run stress tests after deployments
   - Monitor performance trends
   - Set up automated performance testing
