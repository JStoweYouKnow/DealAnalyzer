# Real Estate Deal Analyzer

## Application Architecture

The Real Estate Deal Analyzer will be a Python-based application designed to help users identify real estate investment opportunities that align with their specific 'buy box' criteria. The application will process real estate listing alerts, extract key property information, perform financial analysis, and flag deals that meet the user's predefined investment criteria.

### Main Components:

1.  **Email Parser:**
    *   **Purpose:** To extract relevant property information from incoming real estate email listing alerts.
    *   **Input:** Raw email content (likely in `.eml` format or plain text).
    *   **Output:** Structured `Property` objects containing details like address, price, rent, property type, etc.
    *   **Considerations:** This component will need to be robust enough to handle various email formats from different listing services. It might involve regular expressions or more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

2.  **Deal Analyzer:**
    *   **Purpose:** To perform financial calculations and evaluate properties against the user's investment criteria.
    *   **Input:** `Property` objects from the Email Parser.
    *   **Output:** `DealAnalysis` objects, which include calculated metrics (e.g., downpayment, closing costs, cash flow, COC return, cap rate) and boolean flags indicating whether the property meets each criterion (e.g., 1% rule, cash flow positive, COC benchmark, Cap Rate benchmark).
    *   **Calculations:** This component will implement the financial formulas based on the user's provided criteria (e.g., 20-25% downpayment, 5-7% closing costs, 1% initial fixed costs, 5% maintenance reserve, 1% rule, cash flow, COC return, Cap Rate).

3.  **Criteria Manager:**
    *   **Purpose:** To store, load, and manage the user's investment criteria.
    *   **Storage:** The criteria will be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON or a Python dictionary saved to a file) for easy access and modification.
    *   **Input:** User-defined investment criteria.
    *   **Output:** Accessible criteria for the Deal Analyzer.

4.  **User Interface (UI) / Reporting Module:**
    *   **Purpose:** To present the analysis results to the user in an understandable and actionable format.
    *   **Input:** `DealAnalysis` objects from the Deal Analyzer.
    *   **Output:** A report (e.g., a text file, a simple web interface, or a spreadsheet) summarizing the deals, highlighting those that meet the criteria, and providing detailed financial breakdowns.
    *   **Future Considerations:** A web-based UI could allow for interactive filtering, sorting, and detailed viewing of properties.

### Data Structures:

*   **`Property`:** Defined in `real_estate_data.py`, this dataclass will hold all raw and extracted information about a property.
*   **`DealAnalysis`:** Defined in `real_estate_data.py`, this dataclass will store the results of the financial analysis and the evaluation against the investment criteria.
*   **Investment Criteria:** Will be loaded from `investment_criteria.md` and parsed into a Python dictionary or a dedicated dataclass for easy access by the Deal Analyzer.

### Input/Output Mechanisms:

*   **Input:** Initially, email content will be manually provided or read from a designated directory. In the future, this could be integrated with an email client or a dedicated email inbox.
*   **Output:** Analysis reports will be generated as text files or potentially CSV/Excel files for easy data manipulation. A simple command-line interface (CLI) will be used for initial interaction, with potential for a web UI later.
