# Error Fix Summary - 404 & 400 Errors

## Issues Reported
1. **404 Error**: "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404"
2. **400 Error**: "/api/analyze-file: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400"

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Simplified PDF Extractor (Main Fix)

**File**: [`app/lib/pdf-extractor.ts`](app/lib/pdf-extractor.ts)

**Problem**: The previous implementation had complex worker management code that was causing issues in serverless environments and could lead to PDF extraction failures.

**Solution**: Replaced with a clean, simple implementation using `pdf-parse`:
- ‚úÖ No worker configuration needed
- ‚úÖ Direct dynamic import of pdf-parse
- ‚úÖ Simple buffer handling
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages
- ‚úÖ Proper validation

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: Complex worker setup with polyfills and GlobalWorkerOptions
// NEW: Simple pdf-parse usage
const pdfParse = (await import('pdf-parse')).default;
const pdfData = await pdfParse(buffer, { max: 0 });
```

### 2. Verified Dependencies

**Package**: `pdf-parse@2.4.5` ‚úÖ Installed

**What it does**:
- Parses PDF files without requiring web workers
- Works perfectly in serverless environments
- Extracts text from text-based PDFs
- Returns page count, metadata, and full text

## üß™ Testing

### Option 1: Use the Test Page (Easiest)

I created a standalone test page to verify the API works:

```bash
# 1. Make sure server is running
npm run dev:next

# 2. Open the test page in your browser
open test-upload.html
# Or navigate to: file:///path/to/DealAnalyzer/test-upload.html

# 3. Select a PDF file and click "Test Upload"
```

**The test page will show**:
- ‚úÖ Success with property details
- ‚ùå Error with specific message
- Full API response for debugging

### Option 2: Use the Main App

```bash
# 1. Start server
npm run dev:next

# 2. Open in browser
open http://localhost:3002

# 3. Test file upload:
- Click "Upload File" tab
- Select a PDF file
- Choose funding source
- Click "Analyze Property"
```

### Option 3: Test API Directly

```bash
# Using curl (replace test.pdf with your file)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/analyze-file \
  -F "file=@test.pdf" \
  -F "fundingSource=conventional"
```

## üîç Understanding the Errors

### 404 Error - Possible Causes

1. **Missing static file**: Font, image, or CSS file not found
   - **Check**: Browser Network tab to see which file is 404
   - **Fix**: Usually not critical, can ignore if app works

2. **Wrong API route**: Incorrect URL in code
   - **Check**: Make sure `/api/analyze-file` exists
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Route exists at `app/api/analyze-file/route.ts`

3. **Build issue**: Next.js didn't build properly
   - **Fix**:
     ```bash
     rm -rf .next
     npm run build:next
     npm run dev:next
     ```

### 400 Error - Possible Causes

1. **No file selected** (Most common)
   - **Symptom**: Error says "No file uploaded"
   - **Fix**: Select a file before clicking Analyze
   - **Code**: Form validates this on client side

2. **File too large**
   - **Symptom**: Error says "File size exceeds maximum"
   - **Limit**: 50MB
   - **Fix**: Use smaller file

3. **Invalid file type**
   - **Symptom**: Error about file format
   - **Fix**: Make sure file is actually a PDF

4. **PDF extraction failed**
   - **Symptom**: Error says "Failed to extract text from PDF"
   - **Causes**:
     - PDF is scanned image (no text)
     - PDF is encrypted/password protected
     - PDF is corrupted
   - **Fix**: Try a different, simpler PDF

## üìã Debugging Checklist

If you still see errors, go through this checklist:

### Server Check
- [ ] Server is running: `npm run dev:next`
- [ ] No errors in server console on startup
- [ ] Server running on port 3002
- [ ] Can access http://localhost:3002

### File Check
- [ ] PDF file is less than 50MB
- [ ] PDF is text-based (not scanned image)
- [ ] PDF is not password protected
- [ ] PDF opens normally in PDF viewer

### Browser Check
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console (F12)
- [ ] File input shows selected file name
- [ ] Network tab shows POST to `/api/analyze-file`
- [ ] Response tab shows error details

### API Check
- [ ] Route file exists: `app/api/analyze-file/route.ts`
- [ ] PDF extractor exists: `app/lib/pdf-extractor.ts`
- [ ] pdf-parse installed: `npm list pdf-parse`

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### When Everything Works

**1. Server Console Shows**:
```
=== Analyze File API Called ===
File received: { name: 'property.pdf', size: 123456, type: 'application/pdf' }
Starting PDF extraction with pdf-parse...
Importing pdf-parse...
pdf-parse imported successfully
Parsing PDF...
PDF parsed successfully: { pages: 1, textLength: 1234 }
PDF text extracted successfully - length: 1234 characters
Analysis Results: { meetsCriteria: true, cocReturn: 0.15, ... }
```

**2. Browser Shows**:
- Loading spinner while processing
- Success toast notification
- Property details displayed
- Financial metrics shown
- No errors in console

**3. API Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "property": { ... },
    "cocReturn": 0.15,
    "capRate": 0.08,
    "cashFlow": 250,
    "meetsCriteria": true,
    ...
  }
}
```

   ```bash
   open test-upload.html
   # Select a PDF and test upload
   ```

3. **Check server console** for detailed logs

4. **If you see errors**:
   - Copy the full error message from server console
   - Check the browser Network tab Response
   - Refer to [DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md](DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md)

```bash
npm install
```

### "Port already in use"

```

### Persistent errors after changes
```bash
rm -rf .next

## ‚ú® What Was Fixed

**Before**:
- Complex PDF extractor with worker management
- Potential worker-related errors
- Unclear error messages
- Difficult to debug

**After**:
- Simple, clean PDF extraction
- No worker configuration needed
- Clear error messages with details
- Easy to debug with console logs
- Test page for quick validation

The main change was simplifying the PDF extractor to use `pdf-parse` directly without any worker complexity, which is the root cause of most PDF-related issues in serverless environments.
